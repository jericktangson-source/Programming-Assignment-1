# Programming-Assignment-1
Assignment in CO513

  Learning programing or doing this first assignment was a major challenge for me.I had no background in coding during college,so everything started from zero.Programming is not part our curriculum during my college days as Electrical Engineering student.I spent many hours watching Sir Tim's video lectures repeatedly to understand each step.His clear explanations helped me to grasp the logic behind every instruction.
  
  Writing my first ARM assembly program tested my patience(hahaha).I struggled with loops,registers,memory operations and simulating this in simulator.But through repetition and guidance from Sir Tim's video,I improved(I think hahaha).I learned that programming depends on logic,not memorization.The process taught me discipline and patience.I am thankful to Sir Tim for his detailed lessons that made my assignment 1 becomes possible.
